* =gatsby-play=
** [2020-09-19 Sat]

Catch-up: top-level =node_modules= for the initial (local) Gatsby for creating the site; then another =node_modules= in the actual site directory via =gatsby new=. At this point the initial root =node_modules= (and =package-lock.json=) can probably be removed.

** [2020-06-26 Fri]

Installing Gatsby via:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell-script
  npm install gatsby-cli
#+END_SRC

Keeping it local, running via =node_modules/.bin/gatsby= as required.

New site with:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell-script
  gatsby new gatsby-site
#+END_SRC

On a new checkout, will need an =npm install= in =gatsby-site= to pull packages in. (Possibly also in the directory above, if the =gatsby-cli= install is local.)

Data example. Bring in some styling:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell-script
  npm install gatsby-plugin-typography typography react-typography typography-theme-kirkham gatsby-plugin-emotion @emotion/core
#+END_SRC

(Omitting =--save= for now.)
