* =gatsby-play=
** [2020-06-26 Fri]

Installing Gatsby via:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell-script
  npm install gatsby-cli
#+END_SRC

Keeping it local, running via =node_modules/.bin/gatsby= as required.

New site with:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell-script
  gatsby new gatsby-site
#+END_SRC

On a new checkout, will need an =npm install= in =gatsby-site= to pull packages in. (Possibly also in the directory above, if the =gatsby-cli= install is local.)
